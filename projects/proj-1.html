<p>The project consists of a series of components working together to monitor plants' development.
Within these components the system is able to control temperature, watering, imaging and lighting of said plants.
The aforementioned system will be implemented on one heating chamber and one cooling chamber.
Additionally, we have a series of smaller cooling chambers that test a different cooling system and an
automated plant holder for picture taking.</p>
