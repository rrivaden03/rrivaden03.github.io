<p>The following was a prototype of my Software Project Management class. The development team was set to work for the semester and face different 
    challenges; thus, learning about project management first-hand.</p>

<p>Bike-Share is set to be an application that works as a bike renting system for the community. A user creates a profile and 
    interacts with the program such that they are able to locate a desired available bike near them, unlock it with a QR code, have their trip 
    track by the app and provide payment information after finishing said trip.</p>
    
<p>The prototype of our idea presents the main functionalities of the application (GPS points in map are pre-seeded since we 
    did't have the physical chips to work with)</p>
