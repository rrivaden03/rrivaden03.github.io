# ABOUT SECTION

blurb: <p>Hi! I am Romina, a Computer Engineer graduated from Iowa State University currently working at
  Radio Systems PetSafe Europe in Ireland (and previously at their Corporate - United States location in Tennessee). 
  My main focus is developing firmware and software solutions with the Internet of Things software team at the company. 
  Lastly, if you are remotely curious, RSC is a pet technology company and has little to do with radios.</p>
  <p>When I am not coding for the better good, I'm most likely searching for the
  best photo to take, best scene to draw, best story to read or best film to watch.</p>
